<p>The Mendeley API uses standard HTTP codes to provide the clients with information about whether the request has been successful or not. There are two types of codes returned:</p>

<h5 id="successful-codes">Successful Codes</h5>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>200 OK</strong> - The request was successful and there should be information in the body of the response. This response is usually returned after GET requests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>201 Created</strong> - The request was successful; extra information may or may not be returned in the body of the response, for example, after creation we may return the newly created resource.
          This response is usually returned after creation requests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>204 No Content</strong> - The request was successful and no extra information will be provided in the body of the response. This response is usually given after DELETE requests, though it may be returned in other circumstances. </p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="error-codes">Error Codes</h5>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>400 Bad Request</strong> - The request you sent to the server is invalid. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong> - This error will be returned if the authorization is incorrect - that is, the access_token is not present or it has expired.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>404 Not Found</strong> - The resource you were requesting cannot be found. </p></li>
</ul>
